# react-quiz-app
## Project App Name :
## Helder, Rosie, James, Susan


### Project Brief from FutureProof
* Users should be able start a game with a limited number of players from the same computer.
* Users should take it in turns to answer trivia questions and after a set number of turns a winner should be declared.
* Users should be able to choose the level and topic for their quiz game.

Your website should have the following technical functionality:
* Developers should not spend time writing quiz questions but should instead use an open API for example:Â https://opentdb.com/api_config.php
* Developers should follow TDD practices
* Developers should write their frontend in React.


### Our User Stories
* User should be able to play the game via button
* User should be able to input their username
* User should be able to select level of difficulty
* User should be able to choose 1 out of 5 Categories (Celebs, Mythology, History, Animals, Science & Computers)
* User should have 5 questions displayed 
* User should be able to choose their answer 
* User should be able view their score at the end
* User should have the option to play again


### What we have learned
* Integrate and fetch API which renders new set of questions for user to answer
* Apply tests 
* Efficient usage of states and passing props to children components
* Pass props from Parent to Child vice versa


### What challenges we overcame
* Apply meaningful tests
* Rendering data to pages

### What we struggled with
* Displaying api data on children component
* Mapping and shuffling the answers 


### What we would do differently next time
